This is the chat app created in futter + firebase
This chat application has following features: 
- Login using gmail
- send and receive message (image/text/emoji)
- push notification
- update profile /view profile
- last seen 
- delete/ copy message
It uses firebase as backend. It uses firebase messaging, cloud firestore for storing, firebase storage etc . 

Still there are few functionality  to be added in future like voice/video call which I will work in future. Till then my basic application is ready.
